# Comprehensive Plan for STON.fi Grant Application

## 1. Understanding STON.fi

### What is STON.fi?
STON.fi is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain. It stands out from other DEXs due to its unique features:

- **Gasless Swaps**: Unlike most blockchain transactions that require gas fees, STON.fi enables fee-free trading, significantly reducing transaction costs.
- **Deep Liquidity Aggregation**: The platform aggregates liquidity from various sources to ensure optimal swap rates and minimal slippage.
- **Seamless Trading & Integration**: Built with a focus on speed, accessibility, and Web3 compatibility, making it developer-friendly.
- **TON Blockchain Foundation**: Leverages the scalability and efficiency of The Open Network, which was originally developed by Telegram.

STON.fi serves as a critical infrastructure component in the TON ecosystem, enabling efficient token exchanges and providing liquidity for the growing number of applications being built on TON.

### Grant Program Overview
- Funding amount: Up to $10,000 in USDT
- Focus areas: DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain applications

4. **Institutional Features**: Develop features for institutional lenders and borrowers
5. **Cross-Chain Expansion**: Extend lending capabilities across multiple blockchains

**Revenue Model**: Spread between borrowing and lending rates, liquidation fees, premium features

**Market Potential**: DeFi lending protocols have attracted tens of billions in TVL across various blockchains, with room for innovation in collateralization models.

### 5. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Platform
**Concept**: Build a platform for tokenizing real-world assets (real estate, commodities, art, etc.) on TON blockchain with STON.fi providing the liquidity infrastructure.

**Initial MVP (Grant Phase)**:
- Basic tokenization framework for selected asset classes
- Legal compliance structure for one jurisdiction
- Integration with STON.fi for secondary market trading
- Simple investor dashboard

**Scaling Path**:
1. **Asset Class Expansion**: Add support for more types of real-world assets
2. **Jurisdictional Expansion**: Extend legal compliance to multiple countries
3. **Fractional Investment**: Enable smaller investors to participate in high-value assets
4. **Yield Generation**: Develop mechanisms for tokenized assets to generate yield
5. **Institutional Partnerships**: Partner with traditional financial institutions for larger asset onboarding

**Revenue Model**: Tokenization fees, management fees on assets, secondary market trading fees

**Market Potential**: The tokenization of real-world assets is projected to be a multi-trillion dollar market, with significant growth potential as regulatory frameworks mature.

## 3. Technical Implementation Considerations

### STON.fi SDK Integration Points
For any of the above use cases, integration with STON.fi would typically involve:

1. **Swap Integration**:
   ```typescript
   import { StonFiSDK } from 'ston-fi-sdk';
   
   // Initialize the SDK with your project credentials
   const stonFi = new StonFiSDK({
     projectId: 'your-project-id',
     network: 'mainnet' // or 'testnet'
   });
   
   // Perform a gasless swap
   const swapResult = await stonFi.swap({
     fromToken: 'TON',
     toToken: 'USDT',
     amount: '10.5',
     slippageTolerance: 0.5, // 0.5%
     walletAddress: 'user-wallet-address'
   });
   ```

2. **Liquidity Pool Interaction**:
   ```typescript
   // Add liquidity to a pool
   const addLiquidityResult = await stonFi.addLiquidity({
     tokenA: 'TON',
     tokenB: 'USDT',
     amountA: '5.0',
     amountB: '10.0',
     walletAddress: 'user-wallet-address'
   });
   
   // Get pool information
   const poolInfo = await stonFi.getPoolInfo({
     tokenA: 'TON',
     tokenB: 'USDT'
   });
   ```

3. **Market Data Access**:
   ```typescript
   // Get token price
   const tokenPrice = await stonFi.getTokenPrice({
     token: 'TON',
     currency: 'USD'
   });
   
   // Get market depth
   const marketDepth = await stonFi.getMarketDepth({
     tokenA: 'TON',
     tokenB: 'USDT',
     depth: 10 // Number of orders on each side
   });
   ```
