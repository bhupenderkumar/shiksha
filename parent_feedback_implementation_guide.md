# Parent Feedback Implementation Guide

## Overview

The parent feedback submission system has been updated to properly connect to Supabase and store feedback submissions. The system now allows parents to submit feedback about their children, and administrators to view and manage these submissions.

## URLs for Parent Feedback

1. **Submit Feedback**: 
   - URL: `/parent-feedback-search`
   - Description: Parents can search for their child and submit feedback

2. **View All Feedback** (for administrators):
   - URL: `/view-all-parent-feedback`
   - Description: Administrators can view all submitted feedback with filtering options

3. **Update Feedback Status**:
   - URL: `/update-parent-feedback/:id`
   - Description: Administrators can update the status of a feedback submission

## Database Setup

A SQL script has been created to set up the necessary table in Supabase. You can run this script in the Supabase SQL editor:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `create_parent_submitted_feedback_table.sql`
4. Run the script

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed parentSubmittedFeedbackService.ts**:
   - Updated the `submitFeedback` method to properly connect to Supabase
   - Fixed the `checkExistingFeedback` method to check for existing submissions
   - Ensured proper error handling

2. **Updated ParentFeedbackSubmissionModal.tsx**:
   - Improved form validation
   - Added logic to check if a submission is an update or new
   - Enhanced error handling and user feedback

3. **Created New Pages**:
   - `ViewAllParentFeedback.tsx`: To view and filter all feedback submissions
   - `UpdateParentFeedback.tsx`: To update the status of feedback submissions

## How to Test

1. **Submit Feedback**:
   - Go to `/parent-feedback-search`
   - Select a class and student
   - Click "Submit Your Feedback"
   - Fill out the form and submit

2. **View All Feedback**:
   - Go to `/view-all-parent-feedback`
   - Use the filters to find specific feedback
   - Click on a feedback entry to view details

3. **Update Feedback Status**:
   - From the view all page, click on a feedback entry
   - Change the status (Pending, Reviewed, Responded)
   - Save the changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Supabase connections:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the `ParentSubmittedFeedback` table exists in the `school` schema
3. Ensure that Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured
4. Check that the Supabase URL and API keys are correctly set in your environment variables

## Next Steps

1. Add the new routes to your router configuration
2. Consider adding email notifications when feedback is submitted or status changes
3. Implement a dashboard for teachers to view feedback for their classes
