# Completion Exercise with Drag and Drop

This is a test page for the new drag-and-drop functionality for completion exercises.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to `/test-completion-exercise` in your browser
2. You'll see two example completion exercises
3. Use the switches at the top to toggle between:
   - Drag & Drop Mode (on by default)
   - Show Answers Mode (off by default)

## Features

### Drag & Drop Mode (New)
- Answer options are displayed as draggable badges below the text
- Drag an answer to a blank space to fill it in
- Once an answer is used, it's removed from the available options
- Click "Reset" to start over

### Text Input Mode (Original)
- Type answers directly into the text fields
- Click "Reset" to clear all answers

## Implementation Details

The implementation uses:
- `@dnd-kit/core` for drag and drop functionality
- The existing `DragDropContainer`, `Draggable`, and `Droppable` components
- A new `DraggableCompletionExercise` component that handles the drag-and-drop logic

## Next Steps

- Add animations for dragging and dropping
- Implement a way to remove an answer from a blank and return it to the pool
- Add support for mobile devices with touch events
- Add sound effects for successful drops
