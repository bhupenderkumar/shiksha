# Interactive Assignment Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the steps to complete the interactive assignment feature for children, focusing on creating engaging educational activities like matching, completion, and other interactive exercises.

## Current Status
- Database tables are already created (InteractiveAssignment, InteractiveQuestion, InteractiveSubmission, InteractiveResponse)
- Type definitions are in place (src/types/interactiveAssignment.ts)
- Some components have been started (matching-exercise.tsx, completion-exercise.tsx)
- Basic service functions exist (interactiveAssignmentService.ts)
- Route definitions exist but some pages are missing

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Complete Core Exercise Components
1. Complete/enhance the existing exercise components:
   - Matching Exercise (matching-exercise.tsx)
   - Completion Exercise (completion-exercise.tsx)
   - Drawing Exercise (drawing-exercise.tsx)
   - Multiple Choice Exercise (multiple-choice-exercise.tsx)
   - Ordering Exercise (ordering-exercise.tsx)

2. Create missing exercise components:
   - Sorting Exercise (sorting-exercise.tsx)
   - Puzzle Exercise (puzzle-exercise.tsx)
   - Identification Exercise (identification-exercise.tsx)
   - Counting Exercise (counting-exercise.tsx)
   - Tracing Exercise (tracing-exercise.tsx)
   - Audio Reading Exercise (audio-reading-exercise.tsx)

### Phase 2: Create/Complete Assignment Management Pages
1. Complete InteractiveAssignmentForm.tsx for creating/editing assignments
2. Complete InteractiveAssignmentDetails.tsx for viewing assignment details
3. Complete InteractiveAssignmentView.tsx for students to view and complete assignments

### Phase 3: Implement Assignment Player
1. Complete AssignmentPlayer.tsx for students to interact with assignments
2. Implement progress tracking and scoring
3. Add celebration/feedback features

### Phase 4: Implement Sharing and Analytics
1. Add shareable link functionality
2. Implement progress analytics for teachers
3. Create milestone tracking for student achievements

## Implementation Details

### Exercise Components
Each exercise component should:
- Accept a question object with type-specific data
- Allow for both interactive (student) and read-only (review) modes
- Support saving responses
- Provide immediate feedback when appropriate
- Be visually engaging for young children

### Assignment Management
The assignment management pages should allow teachers to:
- Create new assignments with multiple questions
- Select question types appropriate for the assignment
- Set due dates, difficulty levels, and age groups
- Upload supporting files (images, audio)
- Preview assignments before publishing

### Assignment Player
The assignment player should:
- Present questions in a child-friendly interface
- Support audio instructions
- Track progress through the assignment
- Save responses automatically
- Provide celebratory feedback on completion
- Calculate and display scores

### Sharing and Analytics
The sharing and analytics features should:
- Generate shareable links for assignments
- Track student progress across assignments
- Identify strengths and areas for improvement
- Award badges/milestones for achievements

## Implementation Approach
We'll implement this feature incrementally, starting with the core exercise components, then building the management pages, and finally adding the player and analytics features.
